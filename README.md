# spam-or-ham
In this project for DATA 100 at UC Berkeley, I created a logistic regression classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. The project was originally done in Python through a Jupyter Notebook. Scikit-learn was utilized for machine learning, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for analyzing text data, and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualizations.

Given the fact that the project is still in use for DATA 100, I am unable to publicly post any code. However, I have transcribed relevant information to a report in LaTeX, available above. Code can be seen upon request, of course with the exception of students at UC Berkeley.
