# spam-or-ham
Project for DATA 100 at UC Berkeley.

I created a logistic regression classifier that predicts whether an email should be sent to the spam folder, or gets to stay in the inbox (ham). 

Sci-kit learn was utilized for machine learning, and NLTK was used for analyzing text data.

Given the fact that the project is still in use for DATA 100, I am unable to publicly post any code. However, I have transcribed relevant information to a report in LaTeX, available above. Code can be seen upon request, of course with the exception of students at UC Berkeley.
